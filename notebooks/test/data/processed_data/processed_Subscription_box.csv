1.0,Smells horrible and nothing unique.,"The first thing I did upon opening the box was gag. . .really hard. I honestly thought that expensive cosmetics companies had stopped adding horrible cheap scent to their products, but guess have've become overly accustomed to philosophy, IT and Tarte products.

Later, I used a grey-lavender, which was dynamite for a thirty-something to the present. Don't care to look like an aging hooker.

5.0,Our 5th Grader Loves It...more than Scratch 2.0!,"Our son just received his first installment of Bitsbox, and got started right away. He was thrilled that he could see immediately whether his coding was working or not. As well, the program gives feedback every time he tries to run a script-- if there's a mistake, it lets him know the approximate line that has the mistake. It will really help our son slow down to make sure details are exact-- a great skill for test taking in the classroom. Sharing his app with others is also very easy, and he got such joy out of seeing people react with excitement and fun when trying to play the game he coded. The Bitsbox program allows him to be successful enough to build his confidence to explore writing script on his own, which is something he seemed much more hesitant to do with Scratch 2.0. I think the biggest difference between the two is that Bitsbox makes it so easy to find mistakes every few lines. Plus, I think the layout is more attractive, as Bitsbox literally looks like an app on a smartphone or tablet. So, he gets that sense that he's doing what professional coders do.

1.0,"Absolutely love this subscription, loved the first month, mad about this last one","My niece is 5 years old. So I got her the 5-7 age group STEM. I think the toy was really neat.

They teased me with a $5 Black Friday discount to try them, so I said why not?  Look at all the great stuff they like to put in THEIR boxes..how exciting!<br /><br />My review is going to be one of disappointment.<br /><br />Allure is proud to talk up and flash beautiful pictures in front of me of a wide and varied amount of miscellaneous products they want me to try including surprise bonuses. Here I am a brand new customer delighted to try these varied possible products I see in all the pictures.... Only to get home and open up my bright red box and go through one item after another only to discover they're all masks. From your lips to your feet. I have nothing against masks, I think they're great. However I can go out and buy a mask at any time. In fact one mask would have been fine. but my whole entire box is nothing but masks. Oh wait, there is a teeny tiny little box with three hair rings in it, cute but I think most people have hair ties of some sort? I guess that's for holding back your hair so you can do a face mask, a lip mask ,and put some eye gels on your eyes all at the same time , put the foot masks on too and boom you've used 5/7ths of your box all at once. I get that November is mask month apparently? (just read that somewhere before I wrote this review) If I had known that ahead of time I would not have started an Allure subscription even with a discount? November? Why didn't they send me December? It started soon enough.... just not quite sure this is the box to introduce to a new customer.... Oh wait there's a coupon inside that will also give you a $10 gift to enjoy at Anthropologie..... but only if you spend a minimum of $50. Yay.<br /><br />Well thank you Allure - but I'm not at all impressed and will be canceling my subscription right now. I would not recommend this subscription.

4.0,Time will tell,"I signed up for the 5-7 year old plan since I have a 5 and 6 year old at home. I jumped at this once I saw it. I always had fun educational toys to tinker with growing up, mostly from Radio Shack back then.<br /><br />Kind of bummed out over the first toy. It clearly says 8+ on the box. We were able to get some use out of it, but it was defiantly over their heads/attention span, (Snap Circuits Fundamentals); trying to explain electrical currents to a 5 year old is difficult. Nothing against the product, It is a pretty nice setup. What happened is I played with it for about an hour and let the boys do what they could and I answered any questions they had. They defiantly got some use out of it, I just had to guide them quite a bit. Not a total loss and it will be there for when they are older. Could have been avoided with an age appropriate toy though, especially the first toy out of the gate like that.<br /><br />The value is there though. I feel I got my $20 worth.<br /><br />Edit 9-25-17:<br />I bumped it from 3 stars to 4. Not much has changed, it is still hit and miss. Some shipments have been great, some have not (I'm looking at you magic school bus.) But, the value has been there throughout. We got some great building sets and some fun experiments out of this and I plan on keeping the subscription for a while. I think some of the best things about this subscription are the assortment of products I probobly wouldn't buy on my own, the monthly consistency, and the price; you tend to get very good deals on what is sent.

Great staple colors for a neutral and/or smokey eye. The actual Allure box itself it sturdy with a beautiful saying inside. Sure, there could be a greater variety of products, but for $15 to get an awesome lipstick (not shown in photo since it's in my purse) and way more products than Birchbox or Ipsy, many of which I’m delighted to try since I otherwise would not go out on a limb and just buy without trying.<br /><br />Also, included is a brochure with all the products included in addition to a coupon code for EVERY item and where to buy it.<br /><br />This is just the first box but if my opinion changes I'll update my review.

1.0,"Try Sephora's box for skincare, Ipsy for makeup, and Allure's for the recycling bin","I haven't yet figured out why Allure has such a hard time with a beauty box. Every four to six months, it's like they fired all the bad box people, put someone in who wants to please customers, and you get a great box. But a month or so later, you're back to small, crappy samples and the ever-present awful customer service.<br /><br />This isn't worth $15. If you like the lower end prices of beauty boxes, I highly recommend Sephora (lots of great skin care, excellent sizes, and decent sized makeup, i.e. lip products.) If you don't mind discovering new brands (that means brands you never heard of, and that can be either good or bad), especially makeup, I suggest you give Ipsy a try. Definitely more makeup-heavy than Sephora. Each of these subscriptions if $10 and they are WAY worth more almost every Allure box I've gotten.<br /><br />Addendum: I've since tried Boxycharm, which features full-sized products from brands they actually sell at Sephora and Ulta.

3.0,Hit and miss for girls,"I’d like to suggest that amazon stem club take in to account that a lot of girls do not enjoy toys that are geared towards boys. I have gotten five months of stem club. We have received the magic school bus engineering lab, which was great. Science experiments are for everyone. Then we received the learning resources code & go mouse. Also great, though we had trouble with the mouse going right when we told it to go straight. I have an email in to the company and I understand that it has been a common problem with this mouse. Next we received robotis play 600 pets kit, which is also fine as all kids like pets. Next was the gears gears gears set which was a disaster, but I was unable to return it because the very short 30 day window had passed by the time I opened it and let my girls try it out. It is very frustrating and does not work well. But, it is acceptable for either gender. At this time it seemed that amazon ran out of ideas that would work for both boys and girls so the next item I was set to receive was a Cars 3 Lightening McQueen model kit. Now that item is clearly intended for little boys. While I’m sure there is a little girl out there who’s parent will insist she loves this type of thing, the average little girl does not say hey, I want a model car for my birthday. My girls have less than zero interest in building a model car from the movie Cars, which they also have no interest in watching. And finally, we are set to receive the Zoob builderz 250 piece kit. This box has a very boyish boy on the picture and includes instructions for building both a tricked out boys bike and a dinosaur. Again, leans very much toward the male interest. Amazon needs to get on the ball and stop sending out so many toys that are clearly of more interest to little boys, or change the name to the amazon boys stem club.",0,B01M7UD21X,B01M7UD21X,AFJ76HHRRYYJG5EHTQOAZTGCQOAQ,2017-12-08 23:05:51.662,1,False,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,STEM Club Toy Subscription: 8-13 year olds,4.4,2376,"Subscribe and save up to 40% on STEM Toys Discover highly-rated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math) Toys from leading brands handpicked by Amazon’s Toy experts Toys encourage understanding and exploration of STEM subjects for children in a fun and entertaining way Support the development of essential skills like logic, creativity, and problem-solving Some projects contain instructional booklets and may require support from an adult",5,STEM Club
1.0,"Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease and Increased Mortality correlated with Processed Meat Consumption","&quot;A higher intake of red meat was associated with a significantly elevated risk of total, CVD, and cancer mortality, and this association was observed for unprocessed and processed red meat, with a relatively greater risk for processed red meat.

5.0,Best tea I’ve ever had! So fresh.,"Tea is for the most part the only thing I drink, so my cubbard is packed with brand named teas like Lipton, Twinings, Stash, Bigelow, Tiesta, and tons more and none of them I feel come close to the quality, taste and pureness of Simple Loose Leaf. This is by far the best tea I’ve had before, it’s so fresh and packs so much taste per cup it’s unreal.<br /><br />The first sampler pack was absolutely delicious and opened my eyes to a few teas I haven’t heard of before, the Genmaicha, which was so unique and refreshing, and the Blue Lady. Their version of the blue lady is my favorite tea I have ever had, period. I bought another lavender earl grey tea at my grocery store since and it was so bitter and harsh comparatively, no comparison.<br /><br />After my first month that was only $3, I was hooked! I searched up their website and found they offer green, herbal and black tea boxes as well for sale,  same as here, $11.99 after shipping. They had a deal, 50% any box subscription so I got green and black for only $6 a piece.<br />After receiving I was thrilled to received 8 teas that I have never heard of before in my life. I’ve only tried 3 so far, but all have been winners, especially the cranberry orange herbal. I typically HATE herbal but this was incredible and was packed with dried cranberries.<br /><br />For $11.99, you’re not getting a lot of tea I’m going to be honest, but what you are getting is a nice assortment of high quality tea that you most likely have not heard of before. This is perfect for people like me who is simply bored of the 3-4 choices grocery store shelves provide, and want teas from Africa, India, China, Indonesia and other countries around the world!<br /><br />I attached a picture of all the teas I’ve received so far, left 4=sampler, middle 4=black box, right 4=green box.",1,B07F8Y6BH9,B07F954281,AGCSHQRXX6N4TA2ZNC5BZHQ6PQYA,2018-12-07 16:32:25.596,21,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,"Simple Loose Leaf Tea Subscription Box - 4 Loose Leaf Teas, Curated Monthly Premium Hand Packaged Tea Blends - Loose Leaf Tea : Herbal Tea",4.5,2019,"TOP RATED LOOSE LEAF HERBAL TEAS – Each month, explore 4 curated loose leaf herbal teas from around the world.

5.0,Love this sub,"I love sub boxes... I've been doing boxycharm for a very long time, and cancelled recently due to makeup overload.<br /><br />I was subbed to Allure along with BeautyFix, Sephora Play, etc.  I now only sub if I like a box... if you want to know what is coming in a box, check out mysubscriptionaddiction [dot] com.<br /><br />Considering I'm not a huge fan of masks (okay I use it like once a year!), I decided to wait until Dec-2018 to sub.  I looooove Ofra highlighters, and have been dying to try Juvia's place.  I've heard so many wonderful things about their palettes.  The warrior palette is a lovely warm-nude palette that I otherwise would not have purchased since I have plenty of those shades in my collection.  It's very travel friendly, so I highly recommend not depotting (I regret doing that to mine!).<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'll stick with Allure or not at this point, as I'm pretty up their on frugality.  I usually do cheap The Ordinary ""dupes"" to their skincare items from Sunday Riley.  So we'll see.<br /><br />I did love Sephora Play... I found more favorites from there as they tend to send out classic type of items that most makeup aficionados already own, like benefit lip tint, hoola bronzer, Porefessional primer, etc(and somehow tons of red lipsticks... which I can't decide is better than the brown liquid lipsticks that Boxycharm would send).  I have been out of the sub game when Allure was killing it this fall. I was erroneously subbed to Boxycharm which was putting out boxes like the one with the Laura Lee Party Animal palette (super cringe).  I think that Allure is the best ""budget"" sub box.  I recommend checking what is in what sub box, and only subbing to the box you want in that month.  I no longer sub to a box unless I love 80% of the items and need at least 1.  Take it from someone sub box savvy, the companies do ""spoilers"" of what's coming up.<br /><br />I also highly recommend subbing on Amazon.  I've missed all my boxes from Feb 2018 to Nov 2018.  Every time I call customer service they say my account is active, but I have no charge in my bank and no box.  I called for a number of months before I gave up and said good riddance.  Boxycharm offered the Holy Grail palette from Violet Voss for December, which I already own, so I had to find another box.  I'm glad Allure was offered on Amazon, as I love the December box...

I had to contact customer service when I saw my package was delivered to an address in Florida and I live in California. Customer service was prompt in their reply and told me the system gave me the wrong tracking number and that my order was on it's way still. A few days later my shipment was delivered as promised. The quality of this candy is on par with overpriced fundraiser candy. The kind that comes in the catalog selling wrapping paper and magazine subscriptions. The containers are fairly large, but I didn't like any of the candy that came, and I usually love gummy candy. There was a free sample of caramels they were pretty good, but the three main candy containers were pretty disappointing.  I purchased the 3 pack box and the first shipment had Gustaf's Rainbow Laces which were flavorless and waxy. Gustaf's Jelly Babies, which were covered in this very chalky powder that had an unpleasant after taste. Third container was filled with Dorval Sour Power Green Apple Belts. These also had a very plastic like texture and were sour, but didn't have much flavor beyond that.

5.0,So worth it!,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. He is somewhat advanced for his age so I wasn't worried about the age group suggestions. I have the subscription sent to his grandparents house so when he visits them every month he has a new and cool surprise.

All of the items we have received so far have also been of great quality and were definitely worth the price of the STEM club.

So far we have a wood math set, a bucket of construction gears, a car building set, a coding caterpillar, a science exploration kit, and a patterned drill set.<br /><br />I will note that some of the items could potentially be difficult for a young person (2-3) to immediately grasp and may require more in depth adult assistance to navigate, but they're great all the same.<br /><br />The shipping is also great, at the end of the month (for us) amazon notifies me of shipping and the package always arrives on time or early even.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price<br />Quality<br />Variety of toys<br />Ease of order<br />Packaging<br /><br />Possible Cons:<br />Some toys may have a larger learning curve you really just have to know your child.

5.0,I have a 2 y/o and 4 y/o and they have loved all of these,"We have been subscribing for 5+ months so far with the 3-4 year old age range.  I have a 2 y/o and 4 y/o and they have loved all of these.  Even our friends kids who visit play with the different kits.  I'm overall satisfied with the subscription and am going to change it to the 5-7 age range.  below are short reviews on each kit we have received.<br />We got the gears kit and built some of the models.  They showed a robot on the bucket however it wasn't in the instruction booklet so we had a blast trying to figure it out as a family.  The platforms and gears are sometimes hard to take apart but other then that a good toy, plus it came in a nice hard plastic bucket for storage and additional play.<br />We received the Automobile Engineer kit and the 4 y/o and his friends love to build the different cars (the book has instructions for at least 4).  They either don't want to take it apart or they like to crash it to bits (but that's what boys do).  The kit had color coded pieces to indicate different lengths and sizes which is sometimes hard for the kids to differentiate and the instructions aren't written piece by piece.  Overall it provides just enough learning with limited adult assistance.<br />We received the Cod-a-pillar recently and my kids don't play with it.  We have limited hard flooring that the kids can play on so it doesn't have room to roam.  they both already have remote controlled toys and cars so this is slow and boring waiting for it to turn. Although the most expensive kit so far it's the least enjoyable for our family.<br />We received the drill and screw peg board thing and it's so much fun for both kids.  It comes with interchangeable bits for an electric and hand drill, different color screws and pattern maps.  the little one learns dexterity and the use of tools and the older one follows the patterns.  They actually play well together on this one and the older one teaches the little one the right pattern.  Love this kit! (the drill goes clock wise and counter clock wise to remove screws).<br />We also received the Math Playbox.  It's the most traditional kit since it teaches simple math.  the pieces are hard pressed cardboard vice wood (they look like wood on the pic).  It requires adult assistance to explain the math principles because it's built like a puzzle and my child just matches the pieces to the holes.  It reinforces his numbers and allows him to visualize the math problems.  It bores me as an adult but I don't get complaints when I suggest we play with it so I'll take it as a win.",0,B01M71IUZ7,B01M71IUZ7,AHIA7HSCLSRQ5QK2BZ3BL2I6FLVA,2017-06-28 11:57:46.093,143,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,STEM Club Toy Subscription: 3-4 year olds,4.4,2386,"Subscribe and save up to 40% on STEM Toys Discover highly-rated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math) Toys from leading brands handpicked by Amazon’s Toy experts Toys encourage understanding and exploration of STEM subjects for children in a fun and entertaining way Support the development of essential skills like logic, creativity, and problem-solving New for 2020 - STEM Club now includes limited selection of Arts and Crafts to encourage creativity, inspire imagination and innovation in children",7,STEM Club

1.0,Frustrating products for 3-4 year olds - just trying to sell more junk - not curated!,"My husband and I both have degrees in the sciences (Chemistry/Computer Science) so I was thrilled to find that Amazon had a Stem Club.  But what a disappointment.  The first toy that came was a Automobile Engineering kit, with a cute box and a story book.  However, the pictures in the story book don't look anything like what you can build and my son was so frustrated (and the story itself was not well written).  And while the pieces were bright, the kit was hard to put together, the pictures in the instruction book were hard to follow, the colors didn't match the actual pieces and we all got a bit frustrated with pieces that were the same color but some had odd holes on them and others didn't.  For a 3 - 4 year old this was way too hard to navigate, and an older child would find the story line juvenile. The next kit we got had a drill, colored screws and a white tray with holes on it.  This was somewhat better, as pattern cards were included.  Unfortunately, wasn't very interesting.  The third kit was a cheaply executed maze game that you put together.<br /><br />This club doesn't seem to be actually curated.  I think it is more likely Amazon getting a premium from some lesser known ""toy"" vendors to include their products.

5.0,Excellent Toys for Learning STEM Concepts,"I was worried about the quality of the toys that my kids would receive when I signed up for STEM club based on some of the reviews, but after two months I have been surprised with activities. The first toy was the [[ASIN:B00HSCQ4ZS Young Scientist Club The Magic School Bus Engineering Lab]]and the second toy was the [[ASIN:B01A5YMCH4 Code & Go Robot Mouse Activity Set, 83 piece]]. Both toys have a few basic directions, but the beauty of the toys is that those concepts have led my girls to think of new experiments and projects. My 7 year old absolutely loves completing the tasks and then showing us how she can incorporate other toys and objects into the task.<br /><br />Engineering is more than following instructions on a sheet of paper, it is about taking concepts and applying them in new ways to build something new. The toys I have received so far for my girls are the type of toys that are fun for them to play with, but also provides that &#34;spark&#34; that will help them to think of intuitive new ways to build things.

3.0,is nice overall. All items needed are in place,"Update 3/30/17:<br />I'm not completely satisfied. Product for most recent delivery is much better than last one. Last one wasn't much different than item that was sent prior, in my opinion. Purpose of STEM Education is to explore various concepts and engage audience. Repeating concepts may be good for someone who's going to be quizzed/tested. But considering this if for kids. I was somewhat annoyed that concepts were repeated and there wasn't anything new. It just went from &#34;magic&#34; to &#34;kitchen&#34;. However, last kit is much more improved, as I stated earlier. It's a mechanics kit (levers, linkages, and structures). This is what I expect. Diversity in STEM concepts and material.<br /><br />Product so far, is nice overall. All items needed are in place. Very few items to do the interactive activity need to be replenished if I do this project with my kids. The items that would need to be replenished can easily be found in local grocery stores and really cheap. I would have preferred more material to do the activity several times (with group of kids/friends). But I don't feel that was Amazon's call, so no biggie. The item was from Spangler Science, which always has great, fun products! My one concern was that the description of the item was labeled on the exterior packaging of the item. That did make me feel a little uneasy, knowing anyone processing my package could see what the contents are, and potentially have a reason to steal it.

2.0,8-13 is bad. Others great.,"I have had a great experience in the quality of the lower age toys; however, this first month adding 8-13 is extremely disappointing. This &#34;mechanics&#34; set is filled with quizzes and lessons but none of the projects are actually mechanically sound. Beyond that, every project we have tried has had a minimum of 3 errors in the diagram to the point where the instructions actually contradict themselves.<br /><br />Finally, (and this was the last straw for me) the &#34;catapult&#34; used as an example of a lever was supposed to be used by flipping it with a finger. Catapults use tension (and levers) but even though it would have been idiotically simple to add a rubber band, these &#34;STEM experts&#34; were apparently happier to ignore the concept of tension and just flick the toy across the room. And let's be real: a catapult is a poor example in the first place considering a trebuchet far better illustrates the concept.<br /><br />Obviously this toy is meant to capitalize on parents who like the idea of STEM toys but have no actual experience in the field of physics or engineering while filling your child's head with incomplete theories and bad science.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />But the 3-8 is great :) we'll be keeping those two.",0,B01M71IUZ7,B01M71IUZ7,AFOFQMJ5NUH7JRKXV43USLOTYDPA,2017-07-19 19:53:05.548,4,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,STEM Club Toy Subscription: 3-4 year olds,4.4,2386,"Subscribe and save up to 40% on STEM Toys Discover highly-rated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math) Toys from leading brands handpicked by Amazon’s Toy experts Toys encourage understanding and exploration of STEM subjects for children in a fun and entertaining way Support the development of essential skills like logic, creativity, and problem-solving New for 2020 - STEM Club now includes limited selection of Arts and Crafts to encourage creativity, inspire imagination and innovation in children",7,STEM Club
5.0,The Best Science Subscription I've Had,"I am a home school science teacher with a MS degree in Chemistry.  I LOVE science and have subscribed to a couple other science programs, such as Spangler Science and Magic School Bus.  I was curious as to what Amazon might include in the STEM subscription, so I took my chances.  Well, this is by far the BEST subscription I've ever had!  The other subscriptions got old after a year, and my kids rarely were interested in the boxes we received; I always cancelled the subscription after a year.  With the Amazon STEM program, we receive really interesting, fun, inspiring kits and toys, many way more valuable than the monthly subscription price!  I am enjoying this subscription so much that I have no intention of stopping it.  I have received items such as a wind generator kit (not one of those tiny ones, but a HUGE one that stands a few feet tall!), physics kits, construction kits, Smart Circuits, a National Geographic Fossil kit, a large dinosaur model kit, and several other really cool things. I'm like a kid at Christmas every month!  I have not received any kits that involve wet chemistry or biology, but many have involved experiments in the physical sciences.

4.0,It was worth trying.,"I subscribed because of the Amazon deal where my first box would only cost $3. I was pleasantly surprised by the sturdy packaging and amount of tea I received. Since I already have strainers for brewing loose leaf tea, I have not tried the bags which came in the box. As for the teas, I received Blood Orange Herbal, Blue Lady Grey, QiLan Oolong, and Genmaicha. I really enjoyed the herbal tea (rooibos, orange peel, hibiscus, rosehips, apple pieces, safflowers, rose petals, and orange/vanilla/lemon flavor) and would buy it again on its own. The black tea (whole leaf black tea, blue mellow blossoms, lavender flowers, and bergamot flavor) was pretty good, although I already have other Earl and Lady Grey teas that I enjoy. I found the oolong to be okay and drinkable, but will probably pass it on to a friend. The Genmaicha (bancha green tea, popped corn and toasted hulled rice kernels) was horrible on all counts. Upon opening it smelled odd as though something was old or rancid, but I decided to give it a go anyway.  After forcing three sips I had to pour it out. I don't know if I got a bad bag or I just don't have a taste for that blend, but I'm throwing the rest of the bag in the trash.

1.0,GROSS!!!,"I only had this sub for 2 months. I got the March 2018 box and everything in it seemed.....off. I couldn't get the perfume bottle open to begin with because of the pretentious ridiculous design of it and when I finally did it didn't smell great and spilled everywhere. The lotion that was in the box didn't really have a scent, everything in the box was just...substandard. I thought it was just an off month and then I got April's box. It was slightly better but still not worth $15. I came to the comments section to see what everyone else thought and after reading the comments REALIZED I HAD GOTTEN A YEAR AND A HALF OLD BOX FOR MARCH!!! It is completely disgusting to me that I had to come find out from other customers that products that I could potentially have used on my face and body and would have been well past their use by date didn't even merit a teensy little email from Amazon saying - hey, we're not admitting fault for this, but you got a really frickin old box of makeup products for your March 18 box and you might want to chuck that stuff. I canceled my sub this morning and am requesting a refund. I could have written this off as an honest mistake had I not had to find this out myself from other customers rather than one of the companies being responsibly proactive enough to reach out about it.

4.0,Didn't expect that.,"I was very excited to get my first box since I have been a Tevanna user forever till they went away.  I was out of town when my box arrived ,so I was even more excited when I finally got home and to the mailbox.  I will say, when I opened the mailbox and saw this tiny little box, I thought,  Hmmm, I didn't expect such a tiny box, and for $11.99 are you kidding me?  I will say also, I wasn't really sure what to expect but, with all the hype online and the pretty pictures on the buying page, I wasn't expecting such a tiny thing.  But, after opening the box, and getting those cute little gauze tea bags, for steeping, I felt a little better, it comes with great directions, and a few lines about each tea, I felt a lot better.<br /><br />Now for the tea.  When I saw which teas I was getting in my first box, I was not excited.  I don't like green tea, or  blood orange, in fact, I really don't like Orange at all, but, after steeping my first tea (Blood Orange) I was hooked, The flavor was so soft and the tea was not bitter, it had a lovely flavor and their is a little note in there on how to make it for your water bottle, That's exciting.<br /><br />So all and all.  It is very fun to see the teas and try them,  I've only had one so, I'll update the rating as we move through the teas.<br /><br />Happy Tea drinking.!!",0,B07F8Y6BH9,B07F954281,AH7OXYQVIINIP2XPMZIDMKVXYWUQ,2018-09-24 16:39:06.269,26,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,"Simple Loose Leaf Tea Subscription Box - 4 Loose Leaf Teas, Curated Monthly Premium Hand Packaged Tea Blends - Loose Leaf Tea : Herbal Tea",4.5,2019,"TOP RATED LOOSE LEAF HERBAL TEAS – Each month, explore 4 curated loose leaf herbal teas from around the world.

1.0,Wrong age group and not a great deal.,"I feel bad for writing a review on something that is still being shipped,  but I'm disturbed that Amazon is misrepresenting this program.  I will change the review if necessary once I open and use the first kit:<br /><br />I have signed up for the 5-7 age group.  The toy being shipped says it's for 8+  The set looks simple enough but the colored instructions seem pretty complicated for a 6 YO.  The product is: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KZQZHE2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />So I just looked up the product online. The product is selling for $28 right now on Amazon so at first you think you're getting a good deal at $20 a month, but I see this product was being sold on Nov 7, 2016 for $17 on Amazon. I'm having serious doubts about this program right now as it looks like I'm getting a product that is not in my son's age group and I'm not getting a particularly good deal on it.  I'm thinking now it's better to pick and choose your own STEM toys to make sure you're getting the right age group and a good price.<br /><br />Again,  A little unfair to review on a product that is still in delivery,  but I wanted to let people know now.",0,B01M7UDAVI,B01M7UDAVI,AHUNECRFGNCIGIPVN423AJV6WPHA,2017-01-26 18:56:06.000,61,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,STEM Club Toy Subscription: 5-7 year olds,4.4,2376,"Subscribe and save up to 40% on STEM Toys Discover highly-rated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math) Toys from leading brands handpicked by Amazon’s Toy experts Toys encourage understanding and exploration of STEM subjects for children in a fun and entertaining way Support the development of essential skills like logic, creativity, and problem-solving New for 2020 - STEM Club now includes limited selection of Arts and Crafts to encourage creativity, inspire imagination and innovation in children",6,STEM Club

5.0,Clever way to learn programming,"Bitsbox is a clever, well-designed program to teach an actual programming language. We stopped our subscription after the 4th installment and have no regrets for trying it out.<br /><br />What We Like About Bitsbox:<br />* Kids are learning a programming language with real-world applicability<br />* Beautifully designed materials delivered in a box that lights up our kids' eyes when it shows up<br />* Step-by-step instructions about how to develop each app<br />* A unique QR code technique to transfer an app from a web browser to a mobile device<br />* Includes extra material for parents, encouraging engagement together<br /><br />Concerns:<br />* Having to use a text-based editor instead of a visual programming interface is, in our opinion, a limitation. If a child has good typing skills, this is less of a deal--and it might not be a problem for you. I've just seen how they engage longer in visual programming environments. And if they're preparing for something like Mindstorms, learning in a visual environment with blocks is a helpful thing to get used to.<br />* There are other ways to learn programming that are free. Personally, I think Bitsbox is a little overpriced for the value in comparison to other options. However, there are a couple different pricing options on the website that we didn't catch onto when we started.<br /><br />Our bottom-line:<br />Our 9 year old prefers MIT's Scratch. It has a visual programming interface, it's fun, and you can take someone else's program and ""see inside it"", which is to say ""you can learn from their code"". You can re-mix someone else's program, which is an interesting learning technique. And she enjoys the community aspect of Scratch.<br /><br />Our 7 year old prefers Bitsbox! Despite his just typing in what he's seeing in the code provided, he enjoys the games and when we work together on Bitsbox projects, I think he's picking up on some little things.<br /><br />Where Bitsbox shines is the step-by-step learning process, which is not nearly as strong with Scratch. If you don't mind the Bitsbox subscription fee, do both! The key is that the kids ultimately find that programming is fun and engaging.<br /><br />UPDATE: My 7 year old wanted to jump back into Bitsbox this week. We started tweaking a game and came across a coding issue we couldn't solve. I sent a support email to Bitsbox and literally less than 5 minutes, someone got back to us with a clarifying question. We answered the question, she reviewed the code, and replied promptly explaining the issue in a way we could understand, with an offer for further help. So impressive! I'll suggest that's why Bitsbox may be worth paying for. Good job, Bitsbox! I wish I could share the name of the person who provided the great support but I'm pretty sure it's against Review policy guidelines. But thank you!",0,B07FT4FMWX,B07FSV6S9M,AEPRG5REMEXWAMOM72NDAP3T7GNA,2018-11-25 23:46:39.587,177,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,Bitsbox - Coding Subscription Box for Kids Ages 6-12 | STEM Education,4.4,958,"VOTED #1 STEM BOX FOR KIDS - Kids start by coding from examples and progress quickly to inventing their own apps.

1.0,the world's ugliest eyeliner,"I have gotten  a lot subscription boxes over the last 15 years. I did the New Beauty test tube and I used to prepay for the Allure quarterly boxes- the giant ones that were like 50 dollars and had all full size products (I still have hairspray from these boxes).  I have also done like Play, From the lab, Birch Box, Glossy Box , and some others that I can't remember right now.<br />This box featured an Olay whipped product as the gift for sign up.  Okay, no-no SPF and no discernible benefits from this product. Olay might try next time. Some horrible mineral sunscreen. Just an SPF 30 and like super ashy on whatever your skin color might be. So, no.  The lip balm was full size which is fine but it has a really strong smell. The sample size of the mask was probably two uses, the spray conditioner maybe like a week of usage, the Sunday Riley face oil is fine but the sample lasted 5 days (face, neck, and chest).  There were only two makeup items in the box The Makeup forever  artist pencil designed to used on eyes, lips, and cheeks, but in red this is strictly a lip pencil because how do you blend this into a blush? It's not soft at all so you can  Beauty Blend this until until your face bleeds because this is still not a blush and red eyeliner doesn't work on anyone but, the cast of True Blood. Red eyeliner makes you look like a junkie with allergies. Last  and  least that car wreck of an eyeliner. The color name on this product is Royal Blue, but it's really a matte turquoise long wearing and full-sized ( it's terrible but the plus side is there is plenty of it!). The formula and wear seem solid though (yes, I wore it around my house for a few hours) it's the color. The color is like a crayon- it's simultaneously vivid and flat. Here's the thing, I have a ton of Urban Decay liners in a variety of colors and the way that color works best in liner is if there is metallic element that adds reflection and dimension. This is just the truth. Matte  colors one-dimensional work best in black, brown, navy, gray,  maybe  plum. I get that these boxes are over flowing with black eye liners , but this blue isn't even a trend color. So, I canceled this box because everything in it was a total meh and I really hate the color of the eyeliner and I don't want anymore landfill fodder from any future purchases from whatever crank fiend Allure has curating this garbage box.",0,B0742LVLMJ,B07N1572VL,AESP32OMLGTTRV6ZELR7MKTDX7FQ,2018-08-06 16:38:24.009,17,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,Allure Beauty Box - The Best in Beauty Delivered Monthly,4.2,8521,"The best in beauty delivered monthly: premium beauty products curated by Allure editors delivered to your door each month.

Each item has offered multiple uses and fun for my 5 year old and his friends.

Each experiment has a one time use, so if you mess it up, you have to replace the supplies. Most of these supplies are general household or School needs. The solar generator was the best, and reusable.<br /><br />Code and go robot mouse - this was and continues to be my son's favorite. He and his friend spent hours programing the mouse, though rarely used any of the prefabricated designs. Great for inspiration, creativity and adaptability.<br /><br />Gizmo's building set - offered neat designs and ideas. We haven't spent much time with this set, but my son picked it up and built many creations on his own with little to no interaction or guidance from me.<br /><br />Robotics pet 600 - more complex building than Gizmo's, though offers creativity and adaptability. My son was able to follow the directions with some guidance. It's like an early Lego Technics set.

It would be nice for Amazon to send out a message a day or two prior to shipping with the item description so that you can either pass on that month or select a back up item.

3.0,Just received the second of the same kit in 4 months. Wazzup Amazon?,"I purchased the STEM Club for my grandson who is just turning 5. 5 is a problematic age ... just beginning reading readiness for most kids so they may have trouble with reading some of the STEM vocabulary. I am sure that it is difficult for Amazon to come up with items for this age, Pre-K. I have a bright but not precocious grandson, A lot of things which do not require reading seem to be too simple for him or, if reading is required, he has trouble with some of the vocabulary. I read the reviews for the first kit, the &#34;Young Scientist Club The Magic School Bus Engineering Lab&#34;. Frankly the kit was disappointing because some things worked, some things didn't and the whole thing was &#34;cheesy&#34;. Thin cardboard, poorly thought out sequences of &#34;experiments&#34; and the like. His mom suggested I save my money, or give him a $20 bill. I said we would give it a second chance and we are glad I/we did. The second unit was the &#34;Learning Resources Code & Go Robot Mouse Activity Set&#34; which was a (stored program) robotic mouse with a travel platform (durable), some instructions (which we read and figured out together), cards which were an aid to figuring out the steps for the program, barriers and pictures with which to build obstacle courses and a magnetic wedge of cheese. Eli mastered the entire thing in under a half hour. He knew the mouse was a robot and the objective was to find the cheese, but he got the grasp of programming the mouse without considering the steps as &#34;programming&#34;, he was just telling the mouse what to do. He showed off his new skill to his his mom, dad and grandma when they each arrived. I was excited to watch him learn. It provided for great conversation/discussion. This one was a hit. We are all looking forward to the next kit.<br />The Gears! Gears!

3.0,Seemed like a good deal but not so great,I liked the idea of my kid getting eductaional toys once a month for 20. I even got excited by other reviews showing sometimes relatively expensive toys were sent but overall i did end up cancelling this subscription. I did the 3-4 level for my son and ended up not liking having no control over what we would get. I know thats the whole idea behind subscription boxes but sometimes we got things he already had. Sometimes they said they were sending a certain item and then a different toy was sent by mistake(this was taken care of by amazon customer support though). Maybe my main thing i didnt like was at the 3-4 level they still sent toys that had small parts that are a choking hazard.

2.0,May be worth it in a few months when Amazon learned from reviews,"I signed up the first month and my 3-4 yo did not get the aircraft kit (so, not sure why Amazon says that was an item in past boxes) when I got the first box and did not get that. The math kit, subscription or not, was not a cool item. My 4 year old played with it for 5 minutes, mastered it, and moved on. The item was originally $25 on Amazon, and I would never have even paid $8 for it. Giving Amazon one more shot to make the second box amazing. Otherwise, I can't recommend this program at this time.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL COMMENTS 3/3/107: Amazon just issued me (and I'm sure many unhappy customers) a refund for the first box plus a $10 gift certificate. Talk about a wonderful company! Appreciate them listening to our feedback and striving to make the STEM club great. I will say that I am VERY happy with the 2nd item, which is a Automobile Engineer kit (retailing currently at $33 on Amazon.) My son has the robot engineer kit and we love it, so I was  over the moon when we got the new kit via STEM. Thank you Amazon for listening!

3.0,"Great idea, but . . .","I thought this would be a fun way to try some different teas. I like the packaging, and the reusable, canvas-like, tea bags are a neat idea (if not what is shown in the picture). However, I cannot see trying to clean them after every cup. Most of the tea samples had large amounts of dust and tiny slivers, and I suspect that the end result would have been better if I had actually used the bags. Instead, I used a teapot with a loose-leaf filter. We've tried the orange herbal and the oolong, but we really did not like them.

1.0,Not worth it -- even on sale,"Signed up during the late 2018 subscription box sale. Even with a cheaper first box, this was a regretful waste of money. The candies are worse than grocery store bulk bin selections for a frankly ridiculous price.<br /><br />Sour box in general: Terribly misleading lies. Only 1/7 was described as sour. Another was ""sweet & tart"". The rest were all sweet. I'll run through all 7 (6 plus a bonus) in the November 2018 box:<br /><br />Dorval Sour Power Strawberry/Apple Belts: This was the only content described as sour. Sour Patch Kids are more sour. The belts themselves were unappetizing and stiff. If you blindfolded me, I never could have guessed the flavor.<br /><br />Arway Christmas Tree Pretzel: The pretzels were stale, soggy, or both. Mush coated in flavorless white chocolate.<br /><br />Gerrit's Strawberry Licorice Wheels: Ridiculously bad licorice or nearly palatable wax? I honestly couldn't tell.<br /><br />Arway Dark Chocolate Holiday Nonpareils: Generic dollar store dark chocolate that manages to make Hersheys look gourmet by comparison, managing to be both bitter and chalky.<br /><br />Vidal Gummi Christmas Trees: ""Sweet-tart"" in the same way a tangerine is sour. The gummi texture was passable. The flavor was mild, which was deeply disappointing as one of two remotely sour items in the ""Mostly Sour"" box.<br /><br />Albanese Gummi Snow Flakes: The one completely acceptable item in the box, with a texture similar to a Haribo shark and reasonable flavors.<br /><br />Bonus -- Sweet's Peppermint Salt Water Taffy: As I eat this, I picture a tourist trap beach town. Not the taffy spun in the window at the fancy candy store. This is the taffy down the street, in between the airbrushed t-shirts, ironic snow globes with melted snowmen, sunscreen, and cheap sunglasses.<br /><br />Even on sale, I feel ripped off and regret not heeding the other 1* reviews.

2.0,"Boxes full of miniature snacks for fairies, not people!","I received the 25 snack box for the first time and was not impressed, the box came 1/4 filled, and the other 3/4 was empty space, what a ripoff for $40 per month. Everything was super tiny, I could fit several items in the palm of my hand. The snacks included 3 little bags of pretzels, various kinds of jerky, lots of energy bars, and two little bags of random chips. These things seem like stuff they couldn't sell at a grocery store and they just packed it up in box to resell for unsuspecting customers. I appreciate that the snacks are healthy but I think I can definitely get more worth of my $40 buying it from a supermarket, personally. Maybe if the cost of the subscription box was halved I would continue my subscription, but at the current price, it's best to look elsewhere for snack boxes.<br /><br />I forgot to cancel my subscription so I got a second box, still full of the same little tiny pretzels, energy bars, and jerky. At least this time I got a small bag of cookies...It feels like this company really loves their pretzels, I have so many pretzels now instead of a variety of chips or crisps, how disappointing. To inform how little you're actually getting, I had combined both snack boxes together and there is still space for probably a third box of snacks. If the original box included twice the amount of snacks it had, it would be a better deal, and I would feel like it was worth getting, despite the lack in variety of snacks. As for the taste, I tried about seven snacks and they were OK, but not anything impressive, since they are basically your everyday snacks you could buy from a grocery in mini form.<br /><br />Update:<br />SnackNation offered to provide some additional snacks for no cost for me to try due to me being unhappy with my previous boxes, and I accepted. They shipped me two mini boxes, which were completely stuffed to the brim (unlike my giant box of mostly empty air), but I can't say if this would be true for subscribers for their newer boxes, so I would reserve my judgement on this until I try a full sized box from them.<br /><br />The new snacks they gave me were surprisingly bigger than what they had given me in the past, and again, I do not know if these changes will be reflected in their new boxes, but they had promised me they were changing their curations for future boxes, so I hope this is true for the sake of their subscribers. They included a variety of snacks which I hadn't seen before, and I would say I was happier with this selection that I received for free vs. the selection I had gotten when I paid for the subscription, but this might be due to the changes they were making to their boxes as they had mentioned to me. The snacks are still on the smaller side, but not so much as before, where you felt you got cheated somehow by the tininess of everything. I would say the new snacks are appropriately snack-sized for human beings to consume now, instead of for tiny fairies. But they also included some duplicate snacks between the two mini boxes I received, which could be either a bonus or a con, depending on whether the snack in question tastes good or not.<br /><br />For example, they put the same bag of RIND snack in both boxes, and unfortunately, I have to say this snack is one of the most unpleasant things I have ever placed in my mouth. I've only gotten through half of the first bag and I will question my sanity if I try to attempt to finish the second one. I appreciate the RIND company for trying to come up with healthy snacks, but their versions of dried fruits is absolutely disgusting. The fruits included were dried pineapple, dried kiwi, and dried orange with the peel on. On the back of the snack bag, it encourages you to eat the peel since it contains a lot of nutrients, even more than the fleshy part of the fruit. So I tried to heed their advice and put the whole dried orange in my mouth, peel and all, and chewed it for three seconds and had to spit it back out. It was the most bitter thing I had ever tasted in my life, and I've had tried many bitter things before, but not to this extent. The dried kiwi was like dried extremely sour ??? covered with a very light coating of sweetness which was wholly unpleasant. Only the dried pineapple was passable, but honestly, it tasted like a vampire sucked all the juice out, chewed it a couple times, then spat it into the snack bag for us mere humans to finish.<br /><br />However, the other snacks I have tried have been great so far, and I will post further updates as I go through my snack boxes. I am still undecided whether to restart my subscription, but perhaps I will give them another chance in the future if my finances allow. For now, I would bump my rating to 2.5 stars.",0,B07DVM8MM5,B07DVM8MM5,AE3IGH5CD7KCKS7DW6OGBDSM5ORA,2018-09-08 16:18:39.151,76,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,"SnackNation - Ultra-Premium Healthy Office Snack Box Subscription Deluxe Variety Bars, Chips, Sweets for Employees, Meetings, Holidays: 30 Snacks",3.8,649,"Indulge in tasty chips, nutrition bars, savory jerkies, better-for-you sweets, nuts and more!

3.0,Unimpressed with the first month,"I bought 2 STEM club subscriptions - one for my 6 year old and one for my 3 year old.  The first box for the 6 year old was a toy advertised on the STEM SITE ITSELF as for 3-4 year olds (yes, it says on the box 3 and up) and the box selected for the 3 year old had horrible reviews; fortunately, I was able to cancel before it shipped since it seems they charge for returns.

5.0,Worth every single penny. The best subscription we get.,"Every month is a wonderful surprise. There's a wide variety of kits and we're never sure what's coming until we get the email that it's on the way. Granted, I don't tell my son what's on the way, but by the time it gets here I already know all about it.<br /><br />The kits are all worth more than we're paying for the subscription. A lot of the kits have been pricey enough that we would not have bought them otherwise. I've loved the idea of a Magic Schoolbus kit (that came a few months ago) but was never sure it would be worth the money.<br /><br /> So much of it is stuff that I would never have even thought about getting. That's not to say they aren't high quality, they are, but I can honestly say that buying a three-foot scale model of a T-Rex skeleton (August's kit) has never crossed my mind.<br /><br />Even the sets that didn't blow anyone's socks off (there was a magic kit awhile back, it was nice but not our cup of tea) are well worth the money. So even those few times that the surprise wasn't terribly exciting I wasn't left feeling ripped off.<br /><br />Fantastic subscription, I highly recommend it.",0,B01M7UD21X,B01M7UD21X,AH6LEE2DGCSUWS3GEUWV6QV2BXFQ,2017-09-02 14:48:28.218,2,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,STEM Club Toy Subscription: 8-13 year olds,4.4,2376,"Subscribe and save up to 40% on STEM Toys Discover highly-rated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math) Toys from leading brands handpicked by Amazon’s Toy experts Toys encourage understanding and exploration of STEM subjects for children in a fun and entertaining way Support the development of essential skills like logic, creativity, and problem-solving Some projects contain instructional booklets and may require support from an adult",5,STEM Club

5.0,"After 3-4 months, like this box more than Sephora Play!","Review update 9/13/18:<br /><br />I now I have a few more months of getting these boxes and I'm still very happy with them. Today I received the September box with all sorts of amazing items (Tarteist pro LASHES that are absolutely GORGEOUS) and Drunk Elephant Baby Facial to name a few. I ended up cancelling my Sephora Play subscription recently and I'm glad I did- I NEVER was terribly thrilled with any box I got but Allure has been awesome every month. Sure, there's a few things I may not use or aren't my cup of tea but for the most part there are some amazing products. One month that had a Kat Von D theme they had an amazing purse mirror that I'm a bit obsessed with.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased and have no idea why there are so many negative reviews. This is way better than Play even if it is $5 more.<br />___________________________________<br />I was skeptical about this box after reading the reviews but I have been really disappointed in Sephora Play for the last several months and have considered cancelling. Yes, this one is $15 vs. $10 but so far all the products are one or some combination of 1) something I've seen but have been curious about trying, 2) something totally new and unique, 3) good sized products (most are deluxe sample size but there's been full size as well). I have seen absolutely no repeats or similar products from month to month which has been my biggest complaint about Sephora Play.

4.0,Wonderful gift for an inquisitive child,"Since these toys are for my grandson in another state, I can only speak to what the gifts look like and what feedback I've gotten from his father.

2.0,Confused and disappointed,"I signed my 10 year up for the February kit and he loved it.  After he finished all of the experiments, he noticed on the last page this kit was created by Steve Spangler Science.  He is a HUGE fan of Steve Spangler and watches his TV show and YouTube videos daily.  When we found out this was one of his kits, we thought the next kit would also be created by them, too.  Much to our surprise, instead of receiving a club “box”, we got a padded envelope with a Lego-like construction kit.  The packaging was so different, I thought it was a late birthday gift for my son.  It took me awhile to figure out this was this month’s club kit.  The kit itself is cool, but it’s not what I expect to receive when I sign my son up for a subscription club.  Even he was a bit disappointed.  There is something about opening the box and pulling out all the supplies and instructions and feel like you are getting something special, not just a product I can run out and buy.  The good news is, through this, we found out Steve Spangler has his own subscription club.  We are going to give that a try, so not all was lost.

1.0,Poorly Designed Program,"This program design has many flaws, I have contacted Amazon CS several times and provided my feedback but they have just made it even worse. This program does not offer any flexibility in making a customer selects his toy, it's completely based on &#34;random&#34; system selection of a toy within a specific price range. It's so difficult to get to know what the system will &#34;throw&#34; at you till the order has been generated. Alternatively, Amazon should provide a specific number of toys (5 to 8) per month, out of which a customer can select one given the wide spectrum of what STEM can offer (I assume two toys for each category would be enough, as in 2 for science, 2 for technology, etc.) . The only option available at the moment is to cancel the order if the toy is not adequate - which occurred to me several times - and subsequently cancel your membership and re-join again in order to trigger the system order generation.  I found myself working for the system instead of the other way around, it was quite mundane and boring to cancel and join several times to wish that the system will provide a proper and real STEM item.<br /><br />Customer Service acknowledged that the system is still new and it might have some design flaws, however, the only thing they have implemented since I contacted them a couple of months ago is limiting the times a customer can cancel and re-join the program for reasons I am not aware of..",0,B01M7UD21X,B01M7UD21X,AE6TZFUCMI55TJOKUFWYUMHNMQ2A,2018-04-08 07:36:29.591,40,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,STEM Club Toy Subscription: 8-13 year olds,4.4,2376,"Subscribe and save up to 40% on STEM Toys Discover highly-rated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math) Toys from leading brands handpicked by Amazon’s Toy experts Toys encourage understanding and exploration of STEM subjects for children in a fun and entertaining way Support the development of essential skills like logic, creativity, and problem-solving Some projects contain instructional booklets and may require support from an adult",5,STEM Club

The automotive engineer kit sounded awesome but the directions were pretty complicated and took a long time to construct for a 3-4 year old. For most of the cars in the directions almost all the pieces were required which is limiting if you have multiple kids and frustrating if you can’t find a piece. Kid kinex is a lot easier for them to put together and be creative with whatever they want to make.  The drill set was also a cool idea but we lost interest pretty quick. We stopped the subscription.

The wonderful people at Amazon curating the plethora of STEM toys and picking the right ones to send people.  Great in theory.<br /><br />Execution... not so good.<br /><br />1)  the toys were &#34;barely&#34; over the price of the subscription.  Not much of a &#34;deal&#34;.<br /><br />2) they did not come every month.  they came infrequently.  I think we ended up getting 3 kits in about 6 months...<br /><br />3) no creativity or imagination in what they sent out.  i was hoping for them curating beyond what i could do with a quick google search -- not so much.  But, the straw that broke the camel's back:  At the beginning of March, my son got the Kids First Automobile Engineer Kit -- it was great.  After two long months, he got his next kit...  the Kids First Aircraft Engineer Kit.  Basically the same kit.  Where is the imagination?

No issues putting together/taking apart (though I do help him read the instructions). He's 9, and autistic, and he adores building these functional &#34;simple machines&#34;. I, personally, can't wait until we build the miniature catapult!<br /><br />The second toy is currently on sale...for about $12 more than the subscription cost. Normally, it runs $30 more. So I certainly can't complain about getting a $50 toy for $20! We haven't played with it yet (it's a little more advanced than he is right now) but it looks AMAZING. It's a SmartLab product that can make over 50 computerized &#34;devices&#34; - like a doorbell, light shows, etc. It has a microprocessor, Motion detector, a Light Detector, LED lights, and more.

3.0,Unrealized Potential,"The entire concept is definitely a great idea, and my son is well aware each month he's going to get a new STEM toy.  Just seeing his excitement around what's coming for him is enough to keep the subscription going for now.  At this age, we just want to make sure he's developing a love for STEM.<br /><br />As a former science teacher, the quality of the actual toys/sets/kits selected could be so much better.  The very first one was fantastic - it had three small &#34;science fair&#34; like experiments we did together in our kitchen, and each one had a sticker-like badge to give him upon completion.  We were all excited about building a sense of cumulative growth by putting his badge stickers in his journal each month to see how many cool things we'd do.  But alas, that great setup was only with the first manufacturer, and since then it has been a mix of items from many different manufacturers.  Some are amazing, like a coding mouse + maze game.  Others are pretty disappointing, like a big experiment kit that required buying additional supplies for every experiment.  I'm hoping the quality of the monthly STEM Club goods increases soon.  I'm not sure how long my son's (or my) excitement will last.",0,B01M7UDAVI,B01M7UDAVI,AHSR2ORPPBGVBTOLDIGM2RJXRQMQ,2017-06-26 02:26:51.303,10,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,STEM Club Toy Subscription: 5-7 year olds,4.4,2376,"Subscribe and save up to 40% on STEM Toys Discover highly-rated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math) Toys from leading brands handpicked by Amazon’s Toy experts Toys encourage understanding and exploration of STEM subjects for children in a fun and entertaining way Support the development of essential skills like logic, creativity, and problem-solving New for 2020 - STEM Club now includes limited selection of Arts and Crafts to encourage creativity, inspire imagination and innovation in children",6,STEM Club

2.0,Not enough BANG for your buck!,"To get started the box arrived battered and beaten, which thus the Boba Fett movie moment piece was extremely damaged which was very disappointing. But this box only arrived with 3 items, there was plenty of empty space to add a shirt maybe or something else at least. It's just a poor use of space, so much so I thought I was missing items from the box. I also felt this way because the box wasn't even securely packaged anyone could have just opened it up and took what they pleased, not even taped shut, and it was only until I jumped on here to see that there really was in fact only 3 items. My guess is that they feel that adding a movie moment piece to the package justifies the price for the box, but in my opinion not the quality. My older subscription would arrive with at least 5-6 items no matter what the exclusive pop was.",0,B07GNV45VX,B07GNV45VX,AHY2OX2F244N5LDGTK7SHBJ76YZA,2018-10-31 20:43:19.990,38,True,SUBSCRIPTION BOXES,,4.5,1617,,5,
